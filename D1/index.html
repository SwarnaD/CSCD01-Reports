                                We are all 4th year students with a passion for software design and application creation. Each of us
                                brings a diverse set of skills and overall are all-rounded individuals. Moreover, we have work experiences
                                that allows us to understand the professional settings of the real world and what is required of us to improve
                                and maintain the integrity of new technology. But it's our overall desire to improve society as a whole that drives
                                us to make innovative and high-quality software for consumer/commercial use. We hope to better ourselves and our skills
                                during the process of this project.

                                Through these channels we will be able to keep everything in one place while making sure
                                our work is organized.

                                satisfactory writing. This must be done atleast one day prior to deliverable deadline so the necessary

                                at least 5 hours of their time every week working on this project. This is justified due to everyone in the group being a full-
                                time student, with some having part-time jobs, and to have enough time for work for other courses.

                                is agreed by other members that they are slacking with their contribution, they will be contacted to see if they are doing ok
                                and if they need any assistance. If they do not respond then a warning will be issued. The warning is that if they do not step
                                up and do the work to the best of their ability, they will be reported to the TA/Professor about their behaviour/contribution
                                and, if justifiable, will be kicked from the team. However, we hope this will never happen during the duration of this course.

                            <p>
                                I am a fourth year student at University of Toronto - Scarborough
                                in the Computer Science program with specialization in Information Systems.
                                I am on track to complete my degree and graduate after the Winter 2018 semester.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When I was a teenager I was very interested in technology and especially
                                video games. So like any avid teenage gamer, I wanted to create games so
                                I started to learn how to code and create programs. But then I realized gaming
                                was just a phase that I went through so I moved on to other aspects of programming.
                                In particular, I became very interested in finance and overall the creation of
                                software to benefit an organization. Thus I specialized in Information Systems.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I’ve learned several important concepts during my studies such as the core languages
                                of C, Java, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With those I’ve further learned
                                to program with utilities such as Bash, and Node.js (in addition with Express.js).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While working with Defence Research and Development Canada I’ve learned to work with
                                the VBS2/3 engine and its scripting language, but also the importance of documentation.
                                Now I’m currently working with the Canada Revenue Agency where I am a one team lead
                                programmer in charge of creating programs and macros for the use for the Officers.
                                However, my goal is to become a Full Stack Developer at a finance company.

                                I’m currently in my last year of studies at the University of Toronto Scarborough,
                                specializing in Information Systems. My love for computers started at a very young
                                age, but it wasn't until I participated in various technical extracurricular activities
                                such as Robotics, that I decided to make computer science my career.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During my educational career, I learned to implement various projects involving multiple
                                programming languages such as Python, Java, C. I also gained proficiency in MySQL, HTML,
                                CSS and JavaScript through various courses based on web development and security. Along with this,
                                I had the opportunity to utilize what I learned through internships at TD Bank and CIBC.
                                This corporate world experience helped me decide that I want to further grow in the field of
                                project management. In the future, I plan on working for a couple of years after graduation
                                and then going back to school to complete my Masters in Business Administration (MBA), so that
                                I can further grow in my career.

                            <p>
                                I am finishing up my Computer Science degree at the University
                                of Toronto Scarborough next semester. I have always had a periphery
                                interest in programming since my youth but only fully realized it
                                during programming courses in high school that allowed for creativity
                                in final projects.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Over my studies, I have accrued development experience in web applications,
                                Android applications, graphics engines, machine learning, Unity with real-time
                                multiplayer and computer/network security in addition to studying all relevant
                                background knowledge for those endeavors. Additionally, I have studied in theoretical
                                aspects of computer science including all types of algorithms and their analyses,
                                graph theory and its relation to social and information networks, and principles of
                                programming languages. Just like the specialization of my degree, my real-world
                                experience and skill set is essentially “theoretical”. As a result, I am looking to
                                gain any and all valuable experience in developing useful tools for people outside of
                                an academic context and I am especially hungry to prove myself on this open source project.

                                I am a fourth-year Computer Science student at University of Toronto
                                Scarborough. From a young age, I have had a deep interest in technology,
                                but it wasn’t until I started experimenting in game design that I was
                                able to fully realize my interest in software development.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Throughout my studies, I have gained proficiency in Python, Java, C,
                                and Lua, and have had the opportunity apply my knowledge to several different
                                software development roles; as a programmer, UI designer, and graphic designer.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I currently do indie game development in my spare time; mostly contributing to
                                small projects as a graphic and/or UI designer, but I am also working on a game
                                of my own in preparation for an upcoming internship.

                                I have been studying computer science and programming since highschool and have gathered
                                a broad range of experiences. Through those experiences, I have gained knowledge in

                                testing and more. As a co-op student, I spent more than a year gaining real world industry
