Annotations are not even checked/handled at the moment for legend generation.

Items of note:

1)legend.py line 1300
- add annotations to list of handles
	(for loop on lines 1307, 1312)
	- annotations are stored in ax.text
	- (ax is an Axes object

2)need to make sure it passes the has_handler check (line 1326)
- get_legend_handler (line 1322) references all the way to _default_handler_map (ln 805)
	- need to add annotation here to this mapping (probably as Text)

3) in legend_handler.py
- need to add a class here like HandlerLine2D does
	- probably call it HandlerText or HandlerAnnotation and we need to figure out the appropriate base classes
	- need to study the other handlers like HandlerLine2D to emulate and make it for this
