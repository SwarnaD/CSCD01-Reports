-	Working on an open source and large-scale project requires a lot of
    coordination. Therefore, it’s imperative that matplotlib had a guideline
    and standard for contributing.
-	Quality of tests are important to validate that a solution works as
    opposed to just hoping it works.
-	Fixing bugs in an open source project shouldn’t be a full-time thing,
    rather, something that should be considered a hobby or honing programming
    skills.
-	Something that looks simple to fix can be really complicated; looks can be
    deceiving, just like the matplotlib code.

-   Consider multiple solution rather than go full steam ahead with one to 
    avoid wasting time. 
-   In large open source projects such as Matplotlib, code may be redundant
    as multiple unaffiliated contributers attempt to accomplish similar tasks
    so always fully check if something similar has been implemented before making 
    changed
-   Functions in Matplotlib can be spread over many files and classes, check
    over everything to get a full idea of what the code is doing

-	Debugging is an unbelievably valuable skill to have as a developer, and it can be just as,
    if not more important than the developer's ability to write code.
-	Having good test cases is very important to verify that the code functions according to
    the expectations, and is also useful for finding errors and defects.
-	Many of the issues have a common cause/background. (e.g. there were several bugs related 
    to the legend and tight bbox option)
