-	Working on an open source and large-scale project requires a lot of
    coordination. Therefore, it’s imperative that matplotlib had a guideline
    and standard for contributing.
-	Quality of tests are important to validate that a solution works as
    opposed to just hoping it works.
-	Fixing bugs in an open source project shouldn’t be a full-time thing,
    rather, something that should be considered a hobby or honing programming
    skills.
-	Something that looks simple to fix can be really complicated; looks can be
    deceiving, just like the matplotlib code.
